# Stuff to be done

- [x] Evaluate possible ML models
- [x] Add ML pipeline for GridSearch/RandomSearch with HyerOpt
- [x] Initialize code2vec/code2seq as input parameters 
- [x] Package new metric generator in a docker image for easier execution
- [ ] Update usage docs
- [x] Evaluate RFC, TCC, LCC methods [(from here)](https://github.com/mauricioaniche/ck)
- [x] Add shell scripts for running tools in docker container
- [ ] Use mean embeddings as feature in classification
- [ ] Evaluate current state
- [ ] Consider adding code2seq instead of code2vec for generating numerical representation of source code semantics
